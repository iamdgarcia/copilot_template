# New Project (AI-Bootstrapped)

This repository is incrementally built and maintained by an AI agent.

## How it works
- The **user** writes a request here, e.g.:
  > I want to build a REST API for managing tasks with users and authentication.

- The **agent** reads this prompt and follows the process in `BOOTSTRAP.md`.

- All development is incremental and always follows **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**.

Check `.codex/config.json` for project metadata and `.codex/tasks.md` for the running backlog.
