# Coding Guidelines

- Always apply Test-Driven Development (TDD):
  1. Write/extend failing test first.
  2. Implement minimal code to pass.
  3. Refactor with tests green.

- Respect `.codex/config.json` for language/framework.
- Every new feature requires â‰¥1 test.
- Commit messages must be descriptive.
- Document public functions and classes.
